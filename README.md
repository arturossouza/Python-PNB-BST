## Repository

The file ```pnb_demonstration.ipynb``` have some demonstration on how to use the Pnb_Bst class and the file ```experiments_reproduction.ipynb``` try to reproduce the same experiments of the original article.

Also, note that the code use [Grpahviz](https://graphviz.org/), if you are using ubuntu, make sure to install it on the Ubuntu as well.
